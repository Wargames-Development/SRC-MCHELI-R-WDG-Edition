# MCHELI-Reforged Wargames Edition SRC

This repository is the source code behind [MCHELI-Reforged Wargames Edition]()**ADD LINK**, a further fork of the MCHELI-Reforged [Gitee link](https://gitee.com/TV90/MCH-Reforged), [Github Link](https://github.com/TV90/MCH-Reforged) maintained by [TV90](https://github.com/TV90). This all builds ontop of the original [1.7.10 MCHELI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcheli-minecraft-helicopter-mod) created by EMB4 which was decoded by MOC many years ago since EMB4 left the modding scene.

Please checkout our [Credits Section](#meet-our-team--credits) for the full information.

Further changes are being made in the act of connection with our Wargames Edition mods and balancing features added for a better tied together experience on the Wargames Server. This fork will be kept as close to up to date with the MCHELI-O version however changes ontop of it will have been produced originally by the WDG.

## Compiling a current Version

If you are annoyed by our slow releases (since we work on the server's schedule), and you can see we have done work,
feel free to compile it yourself, however it might not work due to incomplete fixes or updates!

<!-- This is a very basic guide to getting the repo setup, this is on purpose, but could be updated if things change or is wanted -->

   3. For Win11 Shift Right-Click, and select `Open in terminal` This will open a CMD instance in this location, *if this for some reason is a powershell instance please follow below:*
        1. Open a CMD window (search CMD)

        2. cd to the directory:

        ```cmd
            cd /path/to/project-root/dir/
        ```

   4. Grab the .jar file from there. *This mod might be unstable due to the state of current development*

4. Updating your mod
    1. You will notice if you try and use the jar to run the game you will have issues with all the textures and vehicles missing if not crashes. Follow the below steps:

    2. Take the jar and extract it using a unzipping tool (winrar, 7zip, windows extraction),

    3. Find your existing mcheli mod folder, and inside delete the "mcheli" folder. this is not the main mcheli folder shown in the mods folder but the one inside of it.

    4. Upload the mcheli folder you recieved from extracting the jar and put it in its place.

5. Alernatively you should instead go to our hosted main repo and download the mod there: [MCHELI-R/O Wargames Edition](https://github.com/Wargames-Development/MCHELI-R-O-WDG-Edition)
